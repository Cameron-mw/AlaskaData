# AlaskaData
The goal of this project is to gather and compile demographic and geographic data using SQL from communities across Alaska, and visualize that data and related statisics in a web-app format. The entirety of the data comes from the State of Alaska Open Data Geoportal (https://gis.data.alaska.gov).
