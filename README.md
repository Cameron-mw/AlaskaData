# AlaskaData
The goal of this project is to compile and clean geographic and community data from Alaskan communities using DB Browser for SQLite. My goal is to present and visualize that data and related statisics in a web-app format. The entirety of the data comes from the State of Alaska Open Data Geoportal (https://gis.data.alaska.gov).
