# AlaskaData
AlaskaData is a self-guided project with the goal of creating an interactive web-app dashboard for visualizing geographic, educational, and population data from across the State of Alaska. The primary tools being used to complile, clean, and visualize this data are DB Browser for SQLite, HTML, and Python. This is a fun and constantly evolving project to hone my skills in data analysis, and to provide interesing and thought-provoking statistical analyses and research about the state I call home. The entirety of the data used for this project comes from the State of Alaska Open Data Geoportal (https://gis.data.alaska.gov).
